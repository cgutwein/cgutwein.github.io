This site is the home of my personal blog. Content is focused on sports analytics and basic programming techniques for scraping and analyzing sports related data.

## Posts
Since this is a Jekyll site, posts should be submitted in `markdown` and can be pushed directly to the `_posts` folder to become visible on the site.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Amit Merchant](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990) for creating the Reverie template to create this Jekyll powered site.
