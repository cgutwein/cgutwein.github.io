[CG Analytics](https://cgutwein.github.io) is a sports analytics blog powered by Jekyll. My intent for this collection of posts is to dive into sports related topics, typically in a way such that each post has two parts: a technical piece that shares some code snippets and insights on methods for pulling data and doing analysis etc. And the a second post that is meant for a typical consumer of sports related content.

# About Me
I am a Data Scientist and live in Denver, Colorado. I follow the Colorado Rockies (a team that will be featured quite often) and contribute to the blog [Purple Row](https://www.purplerow.com) as a Staff Writer. I like to snowboard, mountain bike, and participate in triathlon.
